# CS 341 Project 1 â€“ CTA Database App
# The goal of this project is to write a console-based Python program that inputs
# commands from the user and outputs data from the CTA2 L daily ridership database.
# SQL should be used to retrieve and compute most of the information, while Python is
# used to display the results and if the user chooses, to plot as well
